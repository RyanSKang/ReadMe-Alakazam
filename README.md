## Description

This project uses Inquirer and node index.js in order to generate a high-quality readme. The purpose of this project was to practice using our index.js in order to create prompts within the terminal in order to create a file of our choosing, in this case a readme, based on a template we created. We need to install Node v16 and install inquirer in order to allow this application to work and generate a readME.md when we execute node index.js in our terminal.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
